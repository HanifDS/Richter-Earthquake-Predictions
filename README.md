# Richter-Earthquake-Predictions

This was a model to predict earthquakes as part of the https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/ competition.

In this particular notebook we first established a baseline model and in gradations iterated through a number of different means by tuning hyper parameters, experimenting with different scalers and algorithms and finally using a gridsearch to establish our final model.

Our final model had an F1 score of 0.7464 placing us in the top 5% of the competition.
